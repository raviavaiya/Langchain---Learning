# 📘 LangChain RAG Project

## 🧠 Project Title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain

This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **OpenAI's LLMs**. The RAG architecture enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base and using that context to generate more accurate answers.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Document ingestion and vector store creation (using FAISS or Chroma)
- 📚 Retrieval of relevant documents based on user query
- 💬 LLM-generated answers augmented with context
- 🧱 Modular design using LangChain components
